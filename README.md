# High Five Bowler Twitter Bot

## Wait, what is it?
This is the source for a Twitter bot that congratulates bowlers for rocking a strike or spare. Let's call it like it is, bowling, it's serious business. And when conducting serious business, sometimes the smallest pat on the back and a good ol' fashioned, "hey, way to go, the team appreciates your solid performance" is all you need to stay inspired and keep fighting the good fight. Bowlers are people too, they deserve this, no, better, they've earned it. I dedicate the source code to them.
